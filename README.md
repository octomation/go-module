## üí° Idea

Define a powerful template that enables us to easily create a new Go module from scratch.
Not only does it provide a starting point for our project,
but it also comes equipped with pre-configured pipelines and inventory.

## üèÜ Motivation

We want to start new projects quickly using best practices
with a predefined structure and focusing on core ideas implementation
rather than wasting time on environment configuration and copying boilerplate code.

The template saves us a lot of time and effort by streamlining the setup process,
allowing us to focus on the essential aspects of our ideas.

## üß© Integration

The library uses [SemVer](https://semver.org) for versioning, and it is not
[BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility)-safe through major releases.
You can use [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage its version.

```bash
$ go get go.octolab.org@latest
```
