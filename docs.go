// Package module provides a template for a typical module written on Go.
//
// It's a good starting point to build your module from scratch and
// not to think about boring stuff such as ci/cd configuring and
// docs publishing.
//
// To learn more about the module, read the docs:
//
//	go doc -all .
//
// Want to know how to write Go doc comments?
// Read the official [guide].
